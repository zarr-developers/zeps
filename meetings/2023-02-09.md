# 2023-02-09

**Attending:** Sanket Verma (SV), Ward Fisher (WF), Isaac Virshup (IV), Virginia Scarlett (VS), Jonathan Striebel (JS), Jeremy Maitin-Shepard (JMS)

## TL;DR:

The meeting was solely focused on discussing open issues related to ZEP1. After the discussion, IV proposed his idea for a variable-length string, which could be a potential ZEP.

**Meeting minutes:**

- Discussion on V3 issues - check issues @ [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/projects/2)
- IV: Strings + variable length binary – New ZEP?
